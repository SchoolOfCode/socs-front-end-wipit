# SOCS (School of Code Stash)

As part of the [School of Code](https://schoolofcode.co.uk/) bootcamp, we have been divided in dev teams of 6 or 5 to work on a project from ideation to deployment in a week.

Our team, **WIPIT**, had been tasked to solve a problem common to all bootcampers. We chose to focus on the accessibility of resources shared by coaches on a daily basis.  

Enters, [**SOCS**](https://socs-ui.onrender.com/).

A centralized app to easily sort all of the resources and make them accessible to everyone.

Front end and back end have been built in two separate repos. You can find the latter [here](https://github.com/SchoolOfCode/socs-back-end-wipit).
